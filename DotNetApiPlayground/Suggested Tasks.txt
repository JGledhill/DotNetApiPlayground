1. Create a Get by Id request in the Book Controller.
2. Create Post and Put requests in the Book Controller.
3. Create a Delete request in the Book Controller.

4. Create a wrapper around the Api responses, to ensure that the response for each endpoint is always in the same format.
   There are a few ways to do this, you could try using middleware like the top answer here:

   Middleware docs: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/?view=aspnetcore-7.0

5. Start using a Database rather than a static class to store data.  
   I recommend Entity Framework Core:

6. Create the Model, Controller and repo for an Author object.  
   Set it up with a Foreign Key to the Books and Create a migration to the database.
